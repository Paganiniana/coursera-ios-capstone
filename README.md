#  Coursera iOS Capstone Project

This is the capstone project for the Coursera Certification, found [here](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-ios-developer?). The project features (1) a signin screen, (2) an onboarding screen, and (3) a menu of items found at a hypothetical *Little Lemon Restaurant.*
